        /* This is xoshiro256+ 1.0, our best and fastest generator for floating-point
           numbers. We suggest to use its upper bits for floating-point
           generation, as it is slightly faster than xoshiro256**. It passes all
           tests we are aware of except for the lowest three bits, which might
           fail linearity tests (and just those), so if low linear complexity is
           not considered an issue (as it is usually the case) it can be used to
           generate 64-bit outputs, too.

           We suggest to use a sign test to extract a random Boolean value, and
           right shifts to extract subsets of bits.

           The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
           a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
           output to fill s. */
